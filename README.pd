I published paper described an application inside Pinterest. Even though this paper is interesting, I cannot find the original github code. 

I refer to https://gist.github.com/BarclayII to reproduce the code.

However, the code for loading the movielens dataset seems to have errors. 

I fixed the data loading part, but cannot convert node attributes into vectors due the difference in node (user, movie)'s attributes.

You can refer to the code if you want to implement in the future.
